//What the this keyword does not do:
	//the this keyword does not refer to the function itself
	//the this keyword does not refer to the functions lexical scope
	//the this keyword has nothing to do with where the function was declared

//The this keyword instead has everything to do with where the function was called
//It's actually a binding that is made when a function is invoked,
//and what it references is determined entirely by the call-site where the function is called.
