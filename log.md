# My Progress

## Learn HTML & CSS - Shay Howe
### Ch.2
**What I've Learned**:
* There's a semantic difference between <strong></strong> and <b></b> as well as between <em></em> and <i></i>
* Prompted me to look up more of the semantic html elements that I haven't really used yet.

## YDKJS - Scope and Closures
### Ch 4
**What I've Learned**:
* Hoisting occurs because the JS compiler sees statements in seperate parts, the variable declaration, and the assignment
* The declaration gets hoisted to determine scope for the JS engine, then the engine does assignment later
* Function declarations are hoisted before variable declarations
* Function declarations are hoisted, but function expressions are not

### Ch 3
**What I've Learned**:
* Function scope encourages the idea of hiding variables/code from the outer scope
* *"Principle of Least Privilege"* - only expose what is minimally necessary, hide everything else
* This also helps with collision avoidance (overwriting an identically named variable) and with global namespace issues
* IFFE's and inline function expressions also help to keep code hidden from outer scope
* Naming anonymous functions and IFFE's can help readabiltity
* Block Scope previously was only found in try/catch blocks in JS
* With the new **let** and **const** keywords, the variables declared by them are now block scoped
* These shouldn't replace the **var** keyword, but should be used alongside it, choosing function scope or block scope when appropriate

### Ch 2
**What I've Learned**:
* Lexical scope stops at the first match, so 'shadowing' is when you use the same identifier name at multiple layers of nested scope, the inner identifier shadows the outer one.
* Don't use the cheat methods for lexical scope, eval() and with()

### Ch 1
**What I've Learned**:
* That javascript is a compiled language, just that it doesn't compile ahead of time,
instead it compiles right before the code is executed.s
* Left hand side lookup - LHS - finding the variable container itself
* Right hand side loopup - RHS - finding the value of a variable and retreiving it

* Nada

## YDKJS - Up and Going
**What I've Learned**:
* Mainly going over the basics, but there are some interesting little tips that are cool
* Smart coercion, adding a + or - in front of a string/variable to convert it to a number
* Implicit conversion in conditionals, using truthy or falsy values

**Link(s) to work**:
* None really
