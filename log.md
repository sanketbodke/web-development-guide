# My Progress

## YDKJS - Scope and Closures
### Ch 1
**What I've Learned**:
* That javascript is a compiled language, just that it doesn't compile ahead of time,
instead it compiles right before the code is executed.s
* Left hand side lookup - LHS - finding the variable container itself
* Right hand side loopup - RHS - finding the value of a variable and retreiving it

**Link(s) to work**:
* Nada

## YDKJS - Up and Going
**What I've Learned**:
* Mainly going over the basics, but there are some interesting little tips that are cool
* Smart coercion, adding a + or - in front of a string/variable to convert it to a number
* Implicit conversion in conditionals, using truthy or falsy values

**Link(s) to work**:
* None really
